## üìì Overview
Kush-Web-Services is my Homelab GitOps and IaC project. This is the second verison of the cluster which uses tools like: [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
My main purpose was to practice K8S, GitOps and RPIs and to build my own infra for deploying my own staff :)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Tech Stack
* [Ansible] - Server configuration
* [Cert-Manager] - SSL certificates management
* [Cloudflare] - Domain and DNS management
* [External-DNS] - SOON... (Syncing DNS records with CF)
* [FluxCD] - My Git repo and cluster syncing
* [Helm] - Package manager for Kubernetes
* [Kubernetes] - Container orchestration
* [Longhorn] - Distributed block storage for peristent storage
* [MetalLB] - Load Balancer for bare metal Kubernetes clusters
* [SOPS] - Encrypted secrets in Git
* [Terraform] - VM provisioning

<br/>

## üìÇ Repository structure
In the `/cluster` dir you'll find the following:
- **base**: directory is the entrypoint to [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
- **crds**: directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists.
- **core**: directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
- **apps**: directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore.
```
./cluster
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ./apps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ./base
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ./core
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ./crds
```


### üíª Deployed services
Explore the `/cluster/apps` folder, you will see cluster's namespaces with all the apps inside.
* **dev** - self hosted dev tools
* **media** - a full media server (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, qBittorrent, and more!)
* **monitoring** - the known monitoring stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Alerts Manager)
* **networking** - mainly Traefik ingress manager and cloudflare
* and there are many more to come...

**some missing charts are deployed via my helm repo: [kws-charts]**

## ‚õµÔ∏è Installation
As an educative project I suggest starting with the manual work, explore Kubernetes, Raspberry PIs, Docker's and build one of your own from scratch.
For those who wants to go to the next stage - yes! you can install the same cluster on your machines! I'll provide the original [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/)'s instructions along with my additions in the `/docs` folder.

## ‚ò†Ô∏èÔ∏è Disaster recovery plan
There are 3 types of backups should be done on the cluster:
* Longhorn PV/PVCs backups
* ETCD state backup
* NAS data backup

For more details go to `/docs/DR-plan.md`

## ü§ù Graditude
Thanks to the great supportive community at [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/).
Most of the support and inspiration for my cluster came from [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p/) and from his [super cluster](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops).
